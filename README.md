# 🏅 Sports Classification Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify different types of sports based on image or motion-related data. It uses models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the correct sport category from a given input dataset.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- To apply machine learning techniques for accurate sports activity classification.
- To explore various preprocessing and feature extraction methods.
- To evaluate the performance of classification algorithms on sports datasets.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Install required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook SportsClassifiction.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains images or feature data representing various sports. (You can include the source if it's a public dataset or summarize the data format if it’s custom.)

## 🔍 Methodology
- Data preprocessing: cleaning and transforming the dataset
- Feature extraction: converting raw data into meaningful attributes
- Model training: using SVM for classification
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## ✅ Results
The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between different sports. (Add specific performance metrics here based on your results.)
